Installation
============

% ./configure
% make
# As root:
% make install

To install in a custom directory:

% ./configure --prefix=/my/dir
% make
% make install

Then make sure the following environment variables contain the correct
paths:

PATH            -> /my/dir/bin
LD_LIBRARY_PATH -> /my/dir/lib
MANPATH         -> /my/dir/share/man
PKG_CONFIG_PATH -> /my/dir/lib/pkgconfig

Notes
=====

* Jellyfish has been devellopped and tested on x86-64 GNU/Linux. It
  should be fairly easy to port on other *NIX platform with the gcc
  compiler, but no guarantee is made. Support for 32-bits platform has
  not been tested.
